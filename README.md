# Task Tracker Application - Backend
The Task Tracker Application is a feature-rich task management system developed using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. It provides users with the ability to efficiently manage their tasks with the following functionalities:

## Features:
- **User Registration and Authentication:**
Users can create an account with a unique email address and a secure password.
Email validation is implemented to ensure that user-provided email addresses are valid.
- **User Login:**
Registered users can securely log in to their accounts using their email and password.
- **Task Management:**
Users can add, view, update, and delete tasks associated with their accounts.
Tasks are organized based on the user's email, ensuring that each user's tasks are kept separate.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java:** The core programming language used for building the application.
- **Spring Boot:** A powerful framework for building Java-based web applications, providing essential features like security, data access, and more.
- **MySQL:** A relational database management system used to store user accounts and task data securely.
- **Spring Security:** Provides robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **RESTful API:** Implements a RESTful API for creating, updating, and retrieving tasks.
- **Email Validation:** Ensures that user-provided email addresses are valid before registration.
- **Password Hashing:** Safely stores and verifies user passwords using strong hashing techniques.

## How to Run the Application:
To run the Task Tracker Application locally or on a server, follow these steps:
- **Clone the Repository:** 
Use git clone to clone the repository to your local machine.
- **Configure the Database:**
Create a MySQL database and update the application properties to specify the database connection details.
- **Build and Run:** 
Use Maven or Gradle to build the application.
Run the application using java -jar.
- Access the Application: 
Open a web browser and access the application at the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080).

I'll implement the frontend for this application. Keep Counting.. :relaxed:
